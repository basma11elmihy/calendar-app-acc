Project Decisions:

1- Simple CSS: I chose css without any UI library or tailwind or bootstrap based on your request to write simple css.
2- Formik: I chose Formik to simplify form management and validation, making it easier to handle user input and form submissions.
3- Yup: It was chosen to define validation schemas for form inputs, ensuring that data entered by users meets certain criteria.
4- Redux-Persist: to persist Redux state in the browser's local storage. It allows the application's state to be persisted across page reloads and browser sessions.
5- React-Router-Dom: to handle navigation within the application, and showcase my ability to handle different routes.
6- Luxon: to work with dates and times in JavaScript based on your request but I would prefer moment more.
